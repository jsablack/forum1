If I am a user:
    
    I want to be able to browse the forums without registering for the site. This way I can both search for information and read posts without having to put forth any additional effort. It also allows me to decide if I am interested in the forum before joining.

    If I decide I want to register for the forum, I want it to be with a secure login and password. Once registered, I want to have the ability to post on all the threads and topics. I want to control posting, editing and deleting all of my posts.

If I am an admin:

    I want to be able to see and manipulate any and all posts, threads, and users. This function exists but is currently unprotected.
